    "> This datasets contains the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs.\n",
    "  WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.\n",
    "  These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. Almost all the numerators are always greater than 10.\n",
    "  For example, 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. The numerator are mostly bigger Because \"they're good dogs Brent.\" \n",
    "  WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage. \n",
    "  This unique rating system is a big part of the popularity of WeRateDogs. The dataset used was gathered from three diffrent     sources in order to have enough information about the ratings."
